I completed this job on behalf of Cadetship Infotech as an web developer Intern .Three tasks have been assigned, and each of the three tasks is contained in three files. I have to create a webpage for the Parallax website as my first work. The following sections ought to be present on the page:1. A basic navigation bar2. A webpage should have four sections at the very least, each of which should showcase one of its main characteristics.
3. A part in the footer that has connections to pertinent websites and social media accounts.4. To arrange the content on the page, use HTML tags such as header, button, article, section, and footer.To complete assignment 2, all you have to do is add flip cards to one of your sections:1. The standard size of cards should be used.2. If you move the pointer or cursor over your card, it should flip.
3. In assignment 3, I have to just create another webpage to your website with a form and a countdown timer. Each card should feature an image on one side and information about the image on the other. The form can be a quiz, a general form, or a form for reviewing your website.
